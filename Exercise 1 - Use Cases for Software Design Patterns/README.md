# Application of Design Patterns

In this task we have applied quite a number of design patterns using example use cases. Each is implemented in Java and used to demonstrate the possible employment for solving certain design problems.

## Design Patterns with Use Cases

### 1. Behavioral Design Patterns

#### Iterator Pattern
**Use Case**: *Playlist Management*
This pattern allows managing a collection of objects, whereby it is relatively easy to add and iterate over them. It encapsulates the iteration logic that enables users to access the collection without exposing its internal structure.

#### Mediator Pattern
**Example/Use Case**: *Chat Application*
This pattern acts as a go-between that enables communication between different components of a system. Actually, this enables various entities to talk about the other not having to refer directly to one another by easing the flow of communication.
End
This pattern can be used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is very useful when managing resources efficiently and preventing conflicts in applications where resources are highly intensive and require centralized control.

#### Builder Pattern
**Example**: *Cooking Recipes*
This pattern enables the construction of complex objects step by step. Therefore, it makes the representation more flexible by separating the process of construction from the process of representation, hence easy to differ for different versions of an object.

### 3. Structural Design Patterns

#### Bridge Pattern

Use Case: Notification System
It makes possible an abstraction of a concept to be released from the implementation, such that one is able to freely evolve different kinds of notifications with their unique mechanisms for delivery. That flexibility makes easy to extend and modify the notification system.

#### Composite Pattern
File System Management.
This pattern enables uniform representation of a tree structure for individual objects as well as compositions of objects. It simplifies the handling of complex hierarchies, such as file systems by treating both individual items and groups uniformly.
This program would illustrate a number of design patterns that had to be implemented in developing scalable and maintainable software. In each pattern, there is a description of a specific kind of design problem and shows how powerful design patterns are in software development.
