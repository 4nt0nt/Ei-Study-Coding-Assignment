## Exercise 1: Use Cases for Design Patterns

### Objective:
This exercise demonstrates the application of six key design patterns (Iterator, Mediator, Singleton, Builder, Bridge, and Composite) to address common software design challenges.

### Design Patterns Implemented:
1. **Iterator Pattern** - Playlist Management
   - Allows sequential access to songs in a playlist without exposing its internal structure.

2. **Mediator Pattern** - Chat Application
   - Enables communication between users through a centralized mediator, simplifying dependencies.

3. **Singleton Pattern** - Database Connection Manager
   - Ensures only one instance of a database connection exists to manage resource efficiency.

4. **Builder Pattern** - Meal Preparation
   - Provides a flexible way to construct complex objects step by step, demonstrated by building a customizable meal.

5. **Bridge Pattern** - Notification System
   - Decouples the abstraction (notification types) from the implementation (delivery mechanisms), allowing independent variation.

6. **Composite Pattern** - File System Management
   - Treats individual files and directories uniformly, supporting hierarchical structures for easier file system operations.


## Exercise 2: Real-Time Chat Application

### Objective:
This exercise implements a real-time chat application using Java, focusing on the Observer, Singleton, and Adapter design patterns to achieve message communication between users in chat rooms.

### Features:
- Users can create or join multiple chat rooms for real-time conversation.
- Users can send and receive messages in real-time, with messages instantly broadcasted to all participants in the chat room.
- Used to notify all users in a chat room when a new message is sent, allowing real-time communication without polling.
- Ensures that only one instance of the server and each chat room exists to manage efficient communication and resource usage.
